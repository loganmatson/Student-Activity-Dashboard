<h2>Problem Description:</h2>
<p>Our Problem was to create a relational database to solve the problem of generally organizing a School/University System's information. Our central entity in the model is the Enrollment entity - Enrollment being each combination of students in a course. The Enrollment is operated in conjunction with the Student and Course Entities (Both Students and Courses as the Primary Keys to facilitate re-enrollment), along with faculty (which may change depending on the enrollment period). We are creating this model in hopes to reliably pinpoint Students' data in relation to their courses, assignments, and grades, as well as data to organize the faculty, their locations and how to contact them if problems arise. Last but not least, we are building this data model in hopes to gain perspicaciousness on the Education System, and give administrators a way to improve it.

<h2>Data Model</h2>

<h3>Explanation of data model:</h3>
<p>Toward the left side of our Data Model Diagram, We have our Big 3 Entities that do not have any Foreign Keys going into them, those being Student, Courses, and Building. We chose these 3 to start off our data model, as these 3 do not have any other dependent relationships to anything else in a traditional instituition. Starting with Building, it has buildingID as a Foreign Key, and buildingDepartments and buildingLocation as fields within it. buildingID can uniquely identify every building in the instituition, buildingDepartments can give a English description of which departments are contained within a building, and buildingLocation can contain an address or directions to a building. Building has a 1 to Many Relationship with </p>
